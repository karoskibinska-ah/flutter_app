# flutter_app

A simple Flutter project I did during one of AirHelp hackathons, after reading [this piece](https://medium.com/asos-techblog/flutter-vs-react-native-for-ios-android-app-development-c41b4e038db9) on Medium.
The tutorial I was using can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab). 

This silly app comes up with random startup names. If you like one, you can add it into Saved Suggestions list.
Fancy that lil' airplane there!
